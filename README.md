Outpost Horizon is a two player game in which the person in VR is working on a semi-automated oil rig in the near-future and the player on a mobile device is helping the VR player make repairs to the rig. The game will be very atmospheric like Firewatch and include environmental storytelling and a robotic assistant to narrate throughout the game. Gradually, the players will learn about the eerie secrets behind the company that built the oil rig. The game will also feature a variety of repair simulation minigames that will rely on both players communicating to solve the puzzles. This will be the key to our innovative gameplay in Outpost Horizon.

Many games feature asymmetric gameplay like Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes (although phone and VR cross play is rare), and walking simulators like Firewatch are great at environmental storytelling, but VR games rarely attempt to integrate complex simulation minigames into a narrative game.
